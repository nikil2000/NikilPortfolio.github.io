								<h2></h2>
										<h2>PPW Lectures</h2>

										<h3>Lecture 1</h3>
										<ul>
											<p>These requisites highlighted in writing guide for business also fittingly consummate several principles of business like writing as noted below: It reveals several basic postulates:Based on the criteria indicated above that define perspectives on teaching practices, it is based on several leading standards:</p>
											<li>Purpose and Audience: To begin with, it will be pertinent to state that the goal of the particular sort of writing and the profile of the target audience ensures that it is possible to understand whether certain kinds of information have to be disclosed or not, and if they do, what form the information must be put in when it is reverted to the reader.</li>
											<li>Conciseness: The advice given here is to just be honest, to tell the message exactly as it is without trying to be poetic, witty, or clever and regarding performance, to remember one thing: brevity does more than amuse.</li>
											<li>Politeness: Anyway the language use is not improper and if at all the language has to be standardized then the language could as well be business standard or even a formal language.</li>
											<li>Formality: Avoid prolixity in writing or in speaking one should not speak in a way that every good English written language should not contain any grammatical flaws in the least, do not use the familiar language, and always use the big word instead of the small word if any.</li>
											<li>Non-sexist Language: A fine order is therefore thereby not to use gender specific terms and to perform a gender switch, plurality or paraphrase instead.</li>
											<li>Proofreading: When people are going to read this it has to make some sense and for the purposes of coherency all the roups wich came to gather to make the whole could have been formed and if only there was someone around to read it out aloud looking for corrections.</li>
											<p>There is also offered a number of helpful tips and practical checklists, the hands and also the outlines of other places where one could work on formation of brief sentences is given.</p>
										</ul>

										<h3>Lecture 2</h3>
										<ul>
											<p>Reviewing itself the lecture which was also in the attempt to write in the language for presentation, I was able to notice some key tips out of it, and these are very useful for me next time for the presentation. Here are the key points:In light of that, here are the main issues/areas:</p>
                                            <li>Introduction Structure: First use an apology if have not had a chance to greet and welcome everybody tell the members that, it is then good to inform the members of the title of the talk and the areas of the talk that would follow and then follow it with a and joke with the members then tell the members the only way they will get a chance to ask questions is when you want to start it as part of the talk.</li>
                                            <li>Linking Phrases: At least, it necessary to have the list of phrases starting (beginning) a new area of the presentation to help crossing the end of segments in section four and the section following it.</li>
                                            <li>Listing and Sequencing: In any case where it is appropriate that for goals, challenges or processes that the listing is suitable, then terms and organizations should be made preferably when speaking in sequences.</li>
                                            <li>Practice: Some extent as it was preferred that the lecturer was to link between different ideas, it will be advisable for the presenter to: Volunteers familiar with the presentations below should memorize the link phrases used below and the introduction in preparation for the presentations.</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Lecture 3</h3>
										<ul>
											<p>From this lecture on language for presentations, I learned how to make my presentations more engaging and coherent. Here’s what stood out to me:</p>
                                            <li>Introduction Tips: Thus, there are two generally acknowledged topical areas of concern in show, namely: On one side, there is an imperative of timely and befitting introduction of the show For the introduction of the show, which is handy, Second, there is always a need to clearly identify what the show posited and where the show’s point of convergence is or lies. In order for me, to make my input, I begin with a welcome or an introduction and the subject of the discourse/ steep and areas that will be of concern and the time for questions and the issues, which will be taken into consideration in the course of whereby the audience gives questions.</li>
                                            <li>Using Linking Phrases: Cataline may be right indicating that it will be possible to benefit from one or other of the transitional words and phrases in an attempt to guide the readers from one segment to the other or even come up with a conclusion regarding one particular view on the topic.</li>
                                            <li>Effective Listing and Sequencing: However, when it is all about things that are encumbers or procedures or goals, there is specific need of such terms that are employed for listing them or for indicating sequences and if audiences will get perplexed.</li>
                                            <li>Concluding Well: It might have been more suitable that while I am concluding the presentation I should simultaneously also re-emphasise the notions that have been quite nicely underlined in the presentation, give a concluding comment, call for the consumers’ questions, and, finally, extend my thanks. It really has a nice tone that is so sweet and proper when heard from the man; moreover, the ending of the story is very fulfilling and a little unconventional.</li>
                                            <li>Practice Makes Perfect: It is necessary that I precisely make sure I copied the interconnecting sentences such as the introduction and so that I should not markedly struggle to tell most of what I have typed in here today and tomorrow.</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Lecture 4</h3>
										<ul>
