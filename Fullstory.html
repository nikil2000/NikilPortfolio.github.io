									<h2><a href="#">Nikil Dissanayaka<br /></a></h2>
									<p>I am a very active 4th year undergraduate student at SLIIT Institute studying for a degree of Bachelor of Science (Hons) IT under the specialisation of Frontend Developer. The first school I attended for my education was R/Eheliyagoda Primary College and attended this school from grade 1 to grade 5 and passed the grade 5 scholarship examination sufficiently well. Subsequent to this I entered R/Eheliyagoda Central College from 6th grade to 13th grade A/L while in this school I gained a solid academic experience as well as O/L & A/L pass. These vital years played a massive impact in defining my academic discipline and love for technology; which has geared me forward to accomplished my intentions at SLIIT.
                                        Currently, I am studying at the SLIIT and I developed my technical skills and IT knowledge, with special emphasis on Frontend Development. In the course of my learning, I have mastered HTML and CSS which form the basis of most web design languages and using JavaScript. Academic projects and coursework have given me exposure to instituting the designs that are used ion implementing functional, responsive, and interactive user interfaces across multiple devices. Since I have been considerably engaged on designing and usability, I have enhanced my ability and skills working with popular frontend frameworks, such as React and Angular. With these frameworks, I have been able to develop engaging and interactive web applications, thus increasing my professional know how and sound critical thinking skills.
                                        Another advantage of my academic life is my transformed capability to engage in several real-life projects. All these projects not only helped me gain clearer understanding of the relevant technologies in frontend but also made me learn how to collaborate with a team, how to discuss ideas and how to be ready to change them to better suit the circumstances. When comprehensively working in groups, I have understood the most complicated issues of total control as per different project management, timing, and feedback sessions. These types of opportunities have been educational and immensely beneficial to transition into a professional setting which relies on teamwork and communication.
                                        It is the creativity side of the frontend development which I find more interesting. Perhaps the most thrilling feature of the job is seeing that vision of the designer come into reality and build aesthetically pleasing and efficient interfaces. As the task here includes simplifying a plethora of information and making it appealing to the users, I find this aspect quite exciting; besides, it allows developing new techniques and learning trends. Since coding and designing is what I feel is what I’ve been called to do, I am compelled to always look at the current trends.
                                        Besides learning computing skills and software development knowledge, I have good analytical skills and problem solving. When solving tasks, I am persistent in finding precise actions aimed at achieving the intended objectives and am very scrupulous while searching for the most rational solutions. Hard work, commitment and perseverance as well as embracing personal development are among the positives I have embraced and have been an asset to my learning experience. I am keen forward to the same bring the same level of passion and dedication to seek an internship position so as to be grouped in a development team and start implementing the things learned in school.
                                        Herein, I am looking for an internship position that will enable me to expand on my technical knowledge, innovation, and commitment in developing user-centred solutions. Based on the skills and experience outlined above, I am sure that my knowledge in frontend development, enthusiastic attitude towards technology, and interest in design will help me successfully work in a versatile development team. The potential to work on real-life cases, improve one’s experience, and deliver valuable ideas to help enhance the desired outcomes is thrilling.
                                        Summing up, I believe that due to my education, knowledge of computer specialist’s tools, and interest in frontend development I will be ideal for an intern in frontend position. The ideas I am learning in class makes me to be so ready to work and add it with practical experience to make the environment I will be working in a better place. It is always a privilege to be a part of a professional team and to apply my knowledge and experience as well as to help the team to evolve a highly-effective organization.</p>
